snowjob
=======

A python script that allows your terminal to snow.

Getting Started
---------------

```bash
$ pip install snowmachine
$ snowmachine
```

You can also tell it to stack the snow if you prefer.

```bash
$ snowmachine --stack=pile
```

If you don't like the unicode particles you can tell it to use
asterisk or some other character.  If you use cmd.exe for example,
this will be required.

```bash
$ snowmachine --stack=pile --particle="*"
```

You can also change the particle colors if you would like:

```bash
$ snowmachine --color=rainbow
```


You can find a bash(shell) script version of this here:
